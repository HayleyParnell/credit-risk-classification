#### Credit Risk Analysis Report


### Overview of the Analysis
 Come along as use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. In this analysis, we use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Results
Accuracy Score: The accuracy score of the machine learning model is 0.99, indicating a high level of overall accuracy in predicting loan outcomes.

Precision Score:

For the "healthy loan"(label 0), the precision score is 1.00, demonstrating that the model correctly identifies all healthy loans.
For the "high-risk loan" (label 1), the precision score is 0.86, indicating that the model accurately identifies 86% of the high-risk loans.

Recall Score:

For the "healthy loan" (label 0), the recall score is 1.00, meaning the model correctly identifies all healthy loans.
For the "high-risk loan" (label 1), the recall score is 0.91, indicating that the model captures 91% of the high-risk loans.

#### Summary
The machine learning model exhibits exceptional performance in predicting credit risk for loans. It achieves high accuracy, precision, and recall scores for both "healthy loans" and "high-risk loans". The model's ability to accurately identify high-risk loans helps mitigate the financial institution's exposure to potential defaults.

Based on the results, I recommend this machine learning model for credit risk assessment in the company. Its high accuracy makes it a reliable tool for aiding lending decisions and minimizing credit risk.
